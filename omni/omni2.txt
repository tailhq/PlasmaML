                              O M N I 2  DATA SET
                                             
  The  /data/omni/low_res_omni/ directory contains the hourly mean values of 
  the interplanetary magnetic  field (IMF) and solar wind plasma parameters 
  measured by various spacecraft near  the  Earth's  orbit,  as  well  as  
  geomagnetic and solar activity indices, and energetic proton fluxes
  known as OMNI2 data. 

  OMNI2 was created at NSSDC in 2003 as a successor to the OMNI data set 
  first created in the mid-1970's.  
                   
  Time spans of various parameters are periodically extended.
   The documentation file at
    http://omniweb.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/html/ow_data.html
    gives the current time spans of the following parameter groups:
    Magnetic field
    Plasma
    Kp index and sunspot number
    AE, AL,AU index
    Provisional AE, AL, AU index
    Quick look AE, AL, AU index
    Dst index
    Provisional Dst index
    Quick look Dst
    Energetic proton fluxes
    ap-index and f10.7_index
    PC(N) index
 ---------------
 Note: see "extended" directoty for more parameters.
 ----------------------------------------------
 
  Data gaps were filled with dummy numbers for the missing hours or entire
  days to make all files of equal length.  The character '9' is used to
  fill all fields for missing data according to their format, e.g.
  ' 9999.9' for a field with the FORTRAN format F7.1. Note that format F7.1
  below really means (1X,F6.1),etc.

  This directory  includes  two types of the ASCII flat files: OMNI2_YYYY.DAT, 
  and OMNI_MYYYY.DAT  where  YYYY  is  a given year. The OMNIYYYY.DAT files 
  contain the original data where  the  IMF  and solar wind velocity vectors 
  are presented in GSE and, for IMF, GSM coordinate  systems.  The modified 
  OMNI_MYYYY.DAT files have been  created  from  these  files with reformatting 
  for COHOWeb compatibility and with the  IMF and velocity 
  vectors having been transformed to  RTN coordinate system. 
                            
--------------------------------------------------------------------------- 

Daily and 27-day Averages files: omni_01_av.dat; omni_27_av.dat; omni_m_daily.dat

We have computed daily and 27-day average values for all the OMNI parameters in the
OMNI2_YYYY.dat files, and we have computed daily averages from the OMNI_MYYYY.dat files.
We have made these lower resolution averages also accessible via OMNIWeb and via anon/ftp.
Only arithmetic averaging was done.  (No averaging of logarithms.)  No threshold numbers 
of finer scale points were required.


The daily averages are taken over OMNI's basic hourly values, and the 27-
day averages are taken over the daily averages.  The corresponding standard 
deviations relate only to these averagings and do not capture the 
variances in the higher resolution data.

The 27-day averages are for discrete Bartels rotation numbers.  Thus the 
first such average fully within 1999 spans January 9 through February 4.

The record format for the daily and 27-day averages is the same as for the 
hourly data, although certain fields have special meanings.

The time words (year, day, hour) correspond to the first hour of the 
average.

The ID's for the magnetic field and plasma spacecraft are set to zero, 
since the daily and 27-day averages frequently involve data from multiple 
spacecraft.

The numbers of fine scale points in the plasma and field averages are 
counts of (1) hourly values contributing to daily averages or (2) daily 
values contributing to 27-day averages.  NOTE THAT WE HAVE NOT REQUIRED ANY 
MINIMUM NUMBER OF POINTS TO COMPUTE AN AVERAGE.  For cases where there was 
only one point, the standard deviations were set to zero.

Kp was treated specially.  After determining daily or 27-averages from 
basic values such as 10 (1), 13 (1+), 17 (2-), 20 (2), the average was 
rounded to the nearest "standard value" of Kp (i.e., 10, 13, 17, 20, ...).  
For cases where the average was exactly in the middle between standard 
values (e.g., 15), the lower standard value (13 in this case) was used.

   (*)   Quasi-GSE for the flow longitude angle means the angle increases from zero
         to positive values as the flow changes from being aligned along the -X(GSE)
         axis towards the +Y(GSE) axis.  The flow longitude angle is positive for 
         flow from west of the sun, towards +Y(GSE).
         The flow latitude angle is positive for flow from south of the sun, 
         towards +Z(GSE)

           If the flag is -1 then data were not checked for magnetospheric
           contamination; this is relevant after 1988/306.

                  DESCRIPTION OF COORDINATE SYSTEMS
 
  The Heliographic Inertial (HGI) coordinates are Sun-centered and inertially
  fixed with respect to an X-axis directed along the intersection line of the
  ecliptic and solar equatorial  planes. The solar equator plane is inclined
  at 7.25 degrees from the ecliptic. This direction was towards ecliptic 
  longitude of 74.367 degrees  on  1  January  1900  at  1200  UT; because of
  precession of the celestial  equator, this longitude increases by 1.4 
  degrees/century. The Z axis  is  directed perpendicular and northward from 
  the solar equator, and the  Y-axis  completes  the right-handed set. This 
  system differs from the usual  heliographic  coordinates  (e.g.  Carrington
  longitudes) which are fixed in the frame of the rotating Sun. 

  The RTN system is fixed at a spacecraft (or the planet). The R  axis 
  is directed radially away from the Sun, the T axis is the cross product of 
  the solar rotation axis and  the  R  axis,  and  the  N  axis is the cross 
  product of the R  and  T  axes.  At  zero  heliographic latitude, when the 
  spacecraft is in the solar equatorial plane, the N and solar rotation axes 
  are parallel.

                 Convention for Latitude and Longitude Angles

  Latitude  and  longitude  angles  of  solar wind plasma flow are generally
  measured  from the radius vector away from the Sun. In all cases, latitude
  angles  are  positive for north-going flow. The flow longitude angles have
  been  treated differently for the near-Earth data, i.e. the OMNI, and for 
  the deep space data. The flow is positive for  the  near-Earth  data  when
  coming from the right side of the Sun as viewed  from  the Earth, i.e. 
  flowing toward +Y from -X GSE or opposite to the  direction of planetary 
  motion. On the other hand, the flow longitudes for the deep space spacecraft
  use the opposite sign convection, i.e. positive for flow in the +T direction
  in the RTN system.
